![Netflix Content Acquisition Dashboard]https://github.com/aditidey-gif/Netflix-Content-Acquisition-Trends/blob/main/Netflix_Dashboard_Image.png?raw=true

**BUILT IN MICROSOFT EXCEL**  

I’ve built this dynamic dashboard to analyze Netflix’s content trends over time.  
The key slicer here is **“Became Available on Netflix In”**, derived from the Date Added field — this represents the year a title was added to Netflix, regardless of its original release date.
